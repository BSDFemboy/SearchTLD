		<h1>Moved to a new server</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>My previous VPS locked down the server without notifying me whatsoever.
            So now this will be hosted along with <a href="https://schizo.gr" target="_blank">my personal website</a>.
            This also means I had to set up Gitea all over again, which wasn't too big of an issue. However
            Since I lost access to the server I could not transfer accounts, so everyone using the instance
            will have to register again. Git was also moved to the domain of my main website because it is shorter
            and more general-purpose.
        </p>
