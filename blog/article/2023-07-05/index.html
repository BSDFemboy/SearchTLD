		<h1>New blog layout and UI</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Pafefs designed and uploaded a very nice and simple blog template on our Gitea instance and recommended
			we use it. Since this seems just as minimal as the previous template and also quite easy on the eyes,
			we decided this is the superior template.
			<br/>
			Since the UI was quite janky and ugly, I redesigned it from scratch. I took much inspiration from the designs of Startpage, LibreX,
			and Yahoo.
