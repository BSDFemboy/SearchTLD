		<h1>Revamped fallback system to improve speed.</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			This update is a little controversial because the new fallback system 
			user <strong>JavaScript</strong>. While yes it's a very disliked Language
			especially in the free software community, you cannot deny that it is 
			very useful and efficient for specific things, one of which is the fallback system.
			The previous method we used to check for fallbacks was to make a second curl request
			to the search engine being used to check if results exist, which slowed down 
			searches by a lot. Now, using JavaScript, the check is done by comparing how many
			results are on the current page and if they are less than 2 (99% of the time means there was no results)
			it will fallback to a different search engine.
			Of course, this code is Libre JS. We will remain fully open source forever!
